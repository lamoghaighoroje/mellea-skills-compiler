# Melleafy Step 2: Element-to-Primitive Mapping

**Version**: 4.1.0 | **Prereq**: `inventory.json`, `classification.json` | **Produces**: `element_mapping.json`

> **Schema**: Output `intermediate/element_mapping.json` MUST conform to `.claude/schemas/element_mapping.schema.json`.

Step 2 reads `inventory.json` and produces `element_mapping.json` — the routing decision for every element: which file in the generated package, which symbol, which Mellea primitive.

**Important**: Step 2 does NOT commit dispositions for tool-dependent elements. Every `TOOL_TEMPLATE` mapping entry is provisional (`final_target_file: "pending_step_2.5"`). Step 2.5 decides `real_impl` vs `stub` vs `mock` and amends.

## Alternative rules

### EXTRACT — one-step vs two-step pattern

Default: one `@generative` slot returning the target schema.

**Two-step pattern applies when** any of:

- Target schema has cross-reference fields (a field that references another field's value in the same document)
- Target schema has more than 3 levels of nesting
- Target schema has optional fields whose presence depends on earlier fields' values
- Target schema has more than 4 fields OR contains `Literal` constraints OR has nested `BaseModel` objects OR lists of complex objects

When two-step applies, produce **two** mapping entries sharing the same `element_id` (suffixed `-step1`, `-step2`):

1. `@generative` slot returning a simplified flat structure (`slots.py:extract_X_raw`)
2. `m.instruct(format=FullSchema, strategy=RepairTemplateStrategy(loop_budget=3))` inline in `pipeline.py`

The reason: `@generative` has no retry/repair mechanism — malformed JSON silently returns empty. `m.instruct(format=...)` with `RepairTemplateStrategy` retries and repairs.

### VALIDATE_OUTPUT — executable vs LLM-judged

Default: `Requirement` with executable `validation_fn` (structural check in plain Python).

LLM-judged (bare `Requirement(description=...)`) only when `content_full` contains words like "accurate," "appropriate," "reasonable," "matches the spirit of" — markers of semantic judgement that can't be expressed in Python.

Record the choice as `validation_kind: "executable" | "llm_judged"` in the mapping entry.

### CONVERSE — three realisations

1. **`m.chat()` — LLM self-talk**: when the source describes multi-turn reasoning within the pipeline ("consider counterarguments then respond"). Emitted inline in `pipeline.py`.
2. **Pipeline parameter with default**: when the source says "ask the user for X." X becomes a parameter on `run_pipeline` with a default, exposed as a CLI flag on `main.py`.
3. **`NotImplementedError` stub**: when the source describes genuine interactive back-and-forth that can't be reshaped into either above — e.g., "iterate with the user until they approve the output." SETUP.md §7 explains the host-adapter requirement.

Decision rule: pick (2) when `content_full` contains "ask the user" or "user provides"; (1) when phrasing is about the agent's own reasoning ("consider," "reflect"); (3) when neither fits. If `classification.json:modality == "conversational_session"`, prefer (1).

### REMEDIATE — loop structure

Three mapping entries for one source element:

1. **Modification step** — `m.instruct(format=PatchSchema)` producing a fix
2. **Evaluation step** — `m.instruct(format=VerdictSchema)` checking whether the fix worked
3. **Loop wrapper** — plain Python `while i < MAX_REMEDIATION_ITERATIONS` tying them together

All three route to `pipeline.py`. `MAX_REMEDIATION_ITERATIONS` is always a `config.py` constant with default 3.

### TOOL_TEMPLATE — provisional file routing

Step 2 always routes `TOOL_TEMPLATE` to `tools.py` initially. Step 2.5d amends based on disposition:

- `real_impl` → stays in `tools.py`
- `stub` or `delegate_to_runtime` → moved to `constrained_slots.py`
- `mock` → moved to `fixtures/mock_tools.py`

Record `final_target_file: "pending_step_2.5"` in the mapping entry until Step 2.5d runs.

---

## Dialect-specific overrides

The dialect mapping table in `docs/dialects/<runtime>.md` takes precedence over the general table above.

Precedence (highest first):

1. Dialect doc's mapping table (source-signal-specific rows)
2. Alternative rules above (tag-specific cases)
3. General tag-to-primitive table (the default)

Record every dialect override with `dialect_override_applied: "<runtime>:<row>"` in the mapping entry.

---

## When LLM judgement is invoked

Step 2 is mechanical wherever possible. LLM invocation is bounded to specific narrowly-scoped decisions:

- `VALIDATE_OUTPUT` semantic-vs-executable classification when phrase-match heuristic is inconclusive
- `CONVERSE` realisation selection when element phrasing doesn't match the three rules
- `DETERMINISTIC` placement when length is borderline and call graph is unclear
- `EXTRACT` two-step eligibility in rare cases where schema analysis is ambiguous

**Parallelization strategy**: Instead of issuing one LLM invocation per element requiring judgment, **collect all judgment-requiring elements in a single pass**, then **dispatch all judgment calls in parallel** (all at once in a single turn using tool-call parallelism). Each judgment call invocation is scoped to a single element; all such invocations can proceed independently since they share no dependencies.

After all parallel judgment calls complete, merge their results back into the mapping entries before finalising `element_mapping.json`.

Output goes into `intermediate/element_mapping_judgment_calls.json`.

## Output: `element_mapping.json`

```json
{
  "mapping_id": "map_001",
  "element_id": "elem_042",
  "target_file": "pipeline.py",
  "target_symbol": "run_pipeline",
  "primitive": "m.instruct",
  "primitive_details": {
    "format_schema": "TriageVerdict",
    "grounding_context_keys": ["ticket_text", "operating_rules"]
  },
  "final_target_file": "pipeline.py",
  "step_2_confidence": 0.9,
  "step_2_rationale": "DECIDE tag with clear enum output → m.instruct with format=DecisionSchema",
  "llm_judgement_required": false,
  "dialect_override_applied": null,
  "validation_kind": null
}
```

**Cross-checks before Step 2 declares done**:

- Count of mapping entries equals count of inventory entries (plus expansions for two-step and remediation)
- Every `NO_DECOMPOSE` element has a mapping entry with `primitive: "none"`
- No mapping entry has empty `target_file` or `target_symbol` (except `NO_DECOMPOSE`)
- Every `target_file` named is in the shape doc's always-emitted list or a conditional file whose trigger is predicted to fire
- Every `dialect_override_applied` non-null value references a real row in the detected runtime's dialect doc

Failure at any check is a generation-halt error. `.melleafy-partial/` retains the intermediate artifacts for debugging.
