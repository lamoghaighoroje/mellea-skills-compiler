# Melleafy Step 7: Static Validation

**Version**: 4.3.1 (2026-04-28) | **Prereq**: Steps 3–6 complete | **Produces**: `intermediate/step_7_report.json`

Step 7 is the workflow's final gate. Seventeen lints in three tiers. No LLM invocations. No mutation of the generated package. Outcome is binary overall — pass or halt.

Run as: `melleafy lint <package_path>` (standalone), or automatically at the end of `melleafy run`.

---

## Three-tier architecture

### Tier 1 — Parseability (halt immediately on failure)

**`parseable`**: every `.py` file in the generated package passes `ast.parse()` without error. Then, the package entry module (`<package_name>.pipeline`) must import cleanly via `importlib.import_module()` in a subprocess. This catches wrong external import paths (e.g. `mellea.stdlib.strategies` vs the real `mellea.stdlib.sampling`) that `ast.parse()` cannot detect.

Implementation:

1. **Parse all .py files in parallel**: For every `.py` file in `<package_name>/`, attempt `ast.parse()` concurrently. Collect ALL parse errors across all files before halting (do not fail on the first error). This gives the repair loop the complete error list for all failing files in one run, reducing repair iterations.

2. **Then, import check**: run `python -c "import <package_name>.pipeline"` as a subprocess from the package's parent directory. A `ModuleNotFoundError` or `ImportError` is a lint failure, not a missing-dependency advisory.

If this lint fails, Step 7 halts. Tier 2 and Tier 3 don't run. The failure report contains all collected syntax errors and import errors (nothing else is meaningful before parsing).

### Tier 2 — Structural lints (collect all, halt before Tier 3)

**Run all 13 lints in parallel.** Each lint is independent and can be executed concurrently. Dispatch all 13 lint operations simultaneously in a single turn (not sequentially, one per turn). All tier-2 lints run to completion even if one fails; results are collected then the tier verdict is determined.

Do not wait for one lint to finish before starting the next — issue all 13 lint checks at once using available parallelism.

**`cross-reference`**: every `element_mapping.json` target symbol exists in the generated package; every external call in `pipeline.py` / `tools.py` has a corresponding `dependency_plan.json` entry. Sub-checks:

- Sub-check A: every `target_symbol` in `element_mapping.json` resolves to a real function/class in the target file
- Sub-check B (intra-package): every relative import and every `from .<module>` import in the generated files resolves to a file within the package. Note: external library imports (e.g. `from mellea.stdlib.sampling import ...`) are validated by the `parseable` importable check, not here.
- Sub-check C: every C6 tool called in `pipeline.py` appears in `tools.py` or `constrained_slots.py`
- Sub-check D: no dead `@generative` slots (defined but never called)
- Sub-check E: no dead requirements lists (defined in `requirements.py` but never attached)
- Sub-check F _(Rule 3-1)_: every parameter in `pipeline.py:run_pipeline` has an explicit Python type annotation. Detection: parse `pipeline.py` with `ast`; for each `arg` in `run_pipeline`'s `arguments`, assert `arg.annotation is not None`. Hard failure — bare parameter names produce untyped CLI interfaces and break downstream validation.

**`validator-soundness`**: scoped to `requirements.py` only. Two sub-checks:

- Sub-check A (KB3): every `validation_fn=` uses `simple_validate()` or a function with signature `(ctx, result) -> ...`
- Sub-check B (KB4): no vacuous lambda body (lambda that always returns `True` regardless of input)

**`session-boundary`** (KB5): each `start_session()` block uses at most one distinct `BaseModel` format type across all `m.instruct(format=...)` calls within it. Note: `@generative` slots each create their own internal `<FunctionName>Response` model; multiple `@generative` slots with different return types in the same session are subject to the same schema-priming risk as `m.instruct(format=...)` with multiple models.

**`variable-safety`**: two sub-checks:

- Sub-check A: no uninitialised names in `except` / `finally` blocks. Detection: any name referenced in an `except` or `finally` block that has no assignment before the enclosing `try` statement is a failure. The correct pattern is to initialise the variable before the `try` block (e.g. `payload = None` before `try: payload = build_payload(...)`).
- Sub-check B: no shadowing of Python builtins in function argument names

**`import-side-effects`** (R19 property 4): no module-level calls at import time outside the allowlist (`logging.getLogger()`, `Final` assignment, `os.environ.get()` for config). No `load_dotenv()` at module level. No network calls at import.

**`import-soundness`**: for every `from mellea.X import Y` or `import mellea.X` statement in the generated package, verify that `mellea.X` appears as a key in `intermediate/mellea_api_ref.json:.modules`. Any import whose module path does not appear there is a hard failure. Detection: parse all `.py` files in `<package_name>/` with `ast`; collect all `ImportFrom` nodes where `module` starts with `"mellea"`; load `mellea_api_ref.json` and check each path against `.modules` keys. If `grounding_unavailable: true`, this lint emits a warning ("module index unavailable — import-soundness check skipped") rather than failing. Common error: shortened paths (e.g. `mellea.model_options`) when the symbol lives deeper in the hierarchy (e.g. `mellea.backends.model_options`). Scope: `mellea.*` imports only — third-party imports (`pydantic`, `anthropic`, etc.) are out of scope.

**`stdlib-arity`**: for each call to a known `mellea.stdlib.*` function in the generated package, verify the argument count and keyword parameter names match the declared signature. A call with the wrong argument count or an unrecognised keyword argument is a hard failure. Detection: parse all `.py` files in `<package_name>/` with `ast`; collect `Call` nodes whose `func` is a `Name` or `Attribute` matching a known stdlib function; check positional arg count and keyword names.

**Signature source**:

The static table below is the primary enforcement mechanism. For functions in this table, the static definition always applies — `mellea_api_ref.json` is not consulted, since these signatures are stable across versions.

| Function          | Required positional         | Optional keyword |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `simple_validate` | 1 (`fn`)                    | none             |
| `req`             | 1 (`description`)           | `validation_fn`  |
| `check`           | 2 (`requirement`, `output`) | none             |

For `mellea.stdlib.*` calls to functions **not** in the table above: if `intermediate/mellea_api_ref.json` is present and `grounding_unavailable: false`, look up the signature at `.modules["<module>"]["<symbol>"]["signature"]` and apply the same positional/keyword check. If `mellea_api_ref.json` is absent or `grounding_unavailable: true`, emit a warning ("unknown stdlib function — verify signature manually") rather than a hard failure.

**`grounding-context-types`**: every `grounding_context=` dict literal in the generated package has only `str` values. Detection: parse all `.py` files with `ast`; find `Call` nodes where a keyword `grounding_context` has a `Dict` value; for each dict value, assert it is a `Constant` (string literal), a `Call` to `str()`, or a `JoinedStr` (f-string). Any value that is a bare `Name`, `Attribute`, or other expression is a **warning** (not hard failure). Correct pattern: `grounding_context={"key": str(some_object)}`. Scope: generated `.py` files only.

**`format-annotation`**: every `m.instruct(...)` call whose result is passed to `model_validate_json()` or assigned to a variable then used in a Pydantic parse must have a `format=` keyword argument. Detection: parse `pipeline.py` with `ast`; find `Call` nodes that are `m.instruct`; trace the result name; if it appears as the argument to `.model_validate_json(...)` and has no `format=` keyword, hard failure. This catches calls that produce untyped JSON strings when structured output was intended.

**`known-behaviours`**: mechanical checks for KB1, KB2, KB3, KB4, KB6, KB7, KB11:

- KB1 (3a): no `m.instruct(format=...)` result accessed as a Pydantic object without a prior parse call. Detection: parse `pipeline.py` with `ast`; identify variables assigned from `m.instruct(...)` calls with a `format=` keyword; flag any attribute access (`.field_name`) or method call (`.model_dump()`, `.model_dump_json()`, `.parsed_repr`) on those variables that does not appear as the argument to `_parse_instruct_result(`, `_safe_parse_with_fallback(`, or `.model_validate_json(`. Hard failure.
- KB2 (3b): complex schemas (BaseModel with >4 fields or any field annotated as `list[...]`) used in `m.instruct(format=...)` must either use `RepairTemplateStrategy` in that call or have the result parsed with `_safe_parse_with_fallback`. Detection: parse `pipeline.py` and `schemas.py` with `ast`; for each `m.instruct(format=Model)` call, look up the model's field count and list annotations in `schemas.py`; if the model qualifies as complex, assert the call has `strategy=` keyword or the result variable is passed to `_safe_parse_with_fallback`. Hard failure.
- KB3 (3c): validator signatures (also checked by `validator-soundness`)
- KB4 (3d): no vacuous validators (also checked by `validator-soundness`)
- KB6 (3f): no `@generative` function parameter uses a name from `intermediate/mellea_api_ref.json:.forbidden_param_names`. Detection: load `forbidden_param_names` from `mellea_api_ref.json`; parse `slots.py` and `constrained_slots.py` with `ast`; for each function decorated with `@generative`, assert no parameter name appears in that list. If `grounding_unavailable: true`, fall back to the static list: `m`, `context`, `backend`, `model_options`, `strategy`, `precondition_requirements`, `requirements`, `f_args`, `f_kwargs`. Hard failure.
- KB7 (3g): no `prefix=<config_constant>` used as a persona/system-prompt mechanism — use `model_options={ModelOption.SYSTEM_PROMPT: <constant>}` instead. Detection: `prefix=` argument whose value is a name from `config.py` (e.g. `PREFIX_TEXT`). Note: `prefix=` for structured output generation (e.g. `prefix='{"result":"`)) is permitted. Import-path validation for `ModelOption` is now handled by the `import-soundness` lint.
- KB11 (3m): every `Optional` field in a P2 `m.instruct` `BaseModel` that corresponds to a user-supplied tool parameter has extraction guidance in its `Field(description=...)`. Detection: parse `schemas.py` with `ast`; find `BaseModel` subclasses whose names end with `Schema` or `Intent` or are referenced as `format=` in a `m.instruct` call; for each `Optional`-annotated field, assert `Field(description=...)` is present and the description string contains at least one of: "extract", "do not ask", "if the" (case-insensitive). Hard failure.

**`doc-citation`**: every `**Verified:**` or `**Ref:**` annotation in `mellea-fy-behaviours.md` that references a `docs.mellea.ai` path must appear in `intermediate/mellea_doc_index.json:.doc_pages`. Detection: read `mellea-fy-behaviours.md`; find all occurrences of `**Verified:**` and `**Ref:**` followed by a URL containing `docs.mellea.ai`; extract the path component; check each path against `doc_pages`. If `doc_pages` is empty (fetch failed at Step 2.5f), emit warning ("doc index unavailable — citation check skipped") rather than failing. Hard failure if `doc_pages` is populated and a cited path is absent.

**`bundled-asset-path-resolution`** (Rule OUT-6, Rule 2.5-2): every reference in the generated package to a path under `scripts/`, `references/`, or `assets/` must be resolved package-relatively via `Path(__file__).parent / ...`. Any code that joins a function-argument path (typically `repo_root`) — or any expression other than `Path(__file__).parent` — with one of those subdirectory names is a hard failure. Detection: parse all `.py` files in `<package_name>/` with `ast`; find `BinOp(left=…, op=Div)` chains and `Call(func=Path)` expressions whose right-hand side begins with a string literal `"scripts/…"`, `"references/…"`, or `"assets/…"` (or the bare component `"scripts"`, `"references"`, `"assets"` followed by another `/` join); for each, resolve the leftmost expression of the join. If it is anything other than `Call(func=Attribute(value=Name("__file__"))…)` rooted at `Path(__file__).parent`, fail with the precise message: _"Bundled asset path '<…>' is resolved via '<expr>'. Bundled assets at `<package_name>/<dir>/` MUST be resolved via `Path(__file__).parent / "<dir>/<file>"` (Rule OUT-6 in `mellea-fy.md`, Rule 2.5-2 in `mellea-fy-deps.md`). Common error: `Path(repo_root) / 'scripts/...'` — must be `Path(__file__).parent / 'scripts' / ...`."_ Scope: generated `.py` files only; the path components are matched against the literal directory names declared in Rule OUT-6.

**`fixtures-loader-contract`** (R16, Rule 4-1): `<package_name>/fixtures/__init__.py` must export a module-level `ALL_FIXTURES` (or `FIXTURES`) list. Detection: AST-parse `fixtures/__init__.py`; require at least one module-level `Assign` (or `AnnAssign`) whose target name is `ALL_FIXTURES` or `FIXTURES`. Hard failure with a message naming both expected attribute names and pointing at `mellea-fy-fixtures.md` for the contract. This is a defence in depth — under the `fixtures_writer.py` architecture (Step 4), violations should be unreachable; the lint exists to catch hand-edited `fixtures/` directories or any future code path that bypasses the writer.

**`runtime-defaults-bound`** (C8 invariant): `<package_name>/config.py` `BACKEND` and `MODEL_ID` values must match the directive recorded at `<package_name>/intermediate/runtime_directive.json`. The compile pipeline writes the directive pre-mellea-fy from `.claude/data/runtime_defaults.json` (or CLI overrides) and injects the same values into the LLM's system prompt; this lint verifies the LLM honoured the instruction. Detection: AST-parse `config.py`; find module-level `Assign` or `AnnAssign` to `BACKEND` and `MODEL_ID` with `Constant` values; compare against the directive. Hard failure on mismatch with a message naming actual vs expected and pointing at `.claude/data/runtime_defaults.json` for the fix. Skipped when the directive file is absent (e.g. package compiled with an older pipeline that did not write the directive).

### Tier 3 — Cross-artifact lints (run only when Tier 2 passes)

**`category-specific`**: conditional per C-category detected in `dependency_plan.json`:

- C1-A: scan `config.py:PREFIX_TEXT` for high-entropy strings (>4.5 bits/char, >20 chars) — likely secrets leaked into persona text
- C1-B: scan `config.py` constants for high-entropy strings
- C6: every MCP tool name in `tools.py` uses the qualified `mcp__server__tool` format
- C7: scan all generated `.py` files for hardcoded credential patterns (private key headers, AWS access key patterns, connection string patterns)

**`melleafy-json-consistency`**: 7 sub-checks verifying `melleafy.json` matches the other artifacts:

- Sub-check A: `melleafy.json` contains the fields required by the export command (the authoritative consumer). Hard-required fields (`manifest_version`, `entry_signature`, `package_name`) — FAIL if absent or if `manifest_version` < 1.1.0. Completeness fields (`source_runtime`, `modality`, `categories_resolved`, `declared_env_vars`, `pipeline_parameters`) — WARN if absent. Extra fields are permitted; no schema file is consulted.
- Sub-check B: `source_runtime` matches `classification.json:source_runtime`
- Sub-check C: `modality` matches `classification.json:modality`
- Sub-check D: `categories_resolved` counts match `dependency_plan.json` category counts
- Sub-check E: `declared_env_vars` set matches env-var references found in generated `.py` files
- Sub-check F: `entry_signature` matches the AST-derived signature of `pipeline.py:run_pipeline`
- Sub-check G: `pipeline_parameters` list matches `run_pipeline`'s parameter list

## Execution rules

**Within a tier**: collect all lint failures; don't halt on the first one.

**Between tiers**: Tier 1 and structural Tier 2 failures (`cross-reference`, `validator-soundness`, `variable-safety`, `import-side-effects`, `import-soundness`, `stdlib-arity`, `grounding-context-types`, `format-annotation`, `known-behaviours`, `doc-citation`, `bundled-asset-path-resolution`, `fixtures-loader-contract`, `runtime-defaults-bound`) trigger the top-level repair loop (see `mellea-fy.md`) before halting. `session-boundary` and `category-specific` failures always halt immediately — no repair is attempted. Tier 3 runs only when Tier 2 is entirely clean.

**Timeout**: any lint exceeding 60 seconds of wall-clock time is recorded as `timed_out` (distinct from `failed`). The lint does not count as passed.

**Not configurable in v1**: no `--skip-lint=<id>` flag. All lints run unconditionally. The only exception: `melleafy lint --lint-version=<v>` runs only the lint set as of version `<v>` (for validating packages generated by an older melleafy).

## Stdout on failure

## `melleafy lint` subcommand

`melleafy lint <package_path>` runs the full lint suite against an existing package without regenerating. Exit code 0 on pass, **11** on fail (distinct from Step 2.5's strict-halt code 10 and generated package exit codes 0–4).

Requires an intact `intermediate/` directory in the target package. If `melleafy.json`, `dependency_plan.json`, or other intermediate artifacts are missing, the lints that need them report "not validatable" rather than false-pass.

---

## What lints do NOT check

- Semantic correctness: lints catch structure, not "does this produce the right answer?"
- Style or formatting: PEP 8 conformance is out of scope
- Dependency resolution: `pip install -e .` is a separate user-run check (R15)
- Style or formatting beyond what the lints above cover

---

## Post-lint fixture smoke-check (`--run` mode, default ON)

After all three static tiers pass, `melleafy validate` executes a single fixture case from the generated package's `fixtures/` directory by default — the first entry of `ALL_FIXTURES`. The static lint suite alone cannot catch runtime errors (Mellea-output schema mismatches, prompt issues, `_safe_parse_with_fallback` returning wrong values), so default-on closes the loop between "compiled" and "actually executes." Pass `--no-run` to skip the smoke check (e.g. for fast static-only iteration). Pass `--run --all` to execute every fixture (1-2 minute per fixture, allow ~5 minutes per fixture for budget).

The smoke check produces one of three verdicts:

- **`passed`** — fixture executed to completion without exception. Exit code **0**. `step_7b_report.json` records the fixture id, duration, and output schema type.
- **`failed`** — fixture raised an exception or violated an assertion the runner can detect. Exit code **12** (distinct from **11** for static lint failure). `step_7b_report.json` records the traceback and fixture context. Does **not** trigger the repair loop — a fixture failure requires human review, not automated re-generation.
- **`skipped`** — LLM backend unreachable (e.g. Ollama not running, API endpoint timing out, missing API key). Exit code **0** with a stderr warning: _"Fixture smoke-check skipped — LLM backend unreachable: <reason>. Re-run `mellea-skills validate <pkg> --run` once the backend is up to verify runtime behaviour."_ `step_7b_report.json` records the verdict as `skipped` with the underlying error. This keeps CI green for environments without an LLM while still nudging local users.

Detection of "backend unreachable" vs "fixture genuinely failed":

- `ConnectionError`, `TimeoutError`, `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`, or any `httpx.ConnectError` thrown during `start_session()` → **skipped**
- Authentication errors (401/403 from a remote API) → **skipped** with a more specific message: _"backend unreachable: authentication failed (check API key or env vars)"_
- Any other exception (TypeError, ValueError, AssertionError, schema validation errors, `mellea` exceptions) → **failed**

The `--run` mode is invoked automatically at the end of the `compile` command — a green compile output now means _the package compiled, passed all 16 static lints, and successfully executed at least one fixture_. The `compile` command exits 0 on a `skipped` verdict (matching the local-CI convention) so users without an LLM backend can still get a passing compile, but the skip warning is printed loudly.
